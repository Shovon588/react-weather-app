## Md. Minul Islam Shovon

React Weather App is an interactive weather forecasting app developed using ReactJs and Openweathermap api. The app will provide you with the current weather details interactively upon typing on the search box. It will immediately return the matched location based on the search and show the result. Also the app will change it's background upon the weather. There is different background available right now (rain, snow, drizzle, haze, fog and so on).
